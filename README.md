# Dark-Old-Reddit
Dark Old Reddit for Firefox

I didn't like the options for Dark mode for reddit or for Firefox in general.

- NOTE: This is for OLD reddit.  I'm sure theres a working one for the new reddit, I don't use that one.

Heres my own.

# Installation:

type about:debugging and click This Firefox

load as a temporary addon.
